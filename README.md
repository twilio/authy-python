# Python Client for Authy API

A python library for using the Authy public API.


## Installation

If you have pip installed it's very easy to install authy, just type

    $ pip install authy

Download the [source code](https://github.com/authy/authy-python/zipball/master) then open a terminal and type:

    $ python setup.py install

_Note that you may need admin permissions to run the above commands._

## Usage

To use this client you just need to import AuthyApiClient and initialize it with your API KEY


    from authy.api import AuthyApiClient
    authy_api = AuthyApiClient('#your_api_key')  

Now that you have an Authy API object you can start sending requests.


## Creating Users

__NOTE: User is matched based on cellphone and country code not e-mail.
A cellphone is uniquely associated with an authy_id.__  

Creating users is very easy, you need to pass an email, a cellphone and _optionally_ a country code:
   
    user = authy_api.users.create('new_user@email.com', '405-342-5699', 57) #email, cellphone, area_code

in this case `57` is the country code(Colombia), use `1` for USA. If non are specified it defaults to USA.

You can easily see if the user was created by calling `ok()`.
If request went right, you need to store the authy id in your database. Use `user.id` to get this `id` in your database.

    if user.ok():
        # store user.id in your user database

if something goes wrong `ok()` returns `False` and you can see the errors using the following code

    user.errors()

it returns a dictionary explaining what went wrong with the request.


## Verifying Tokens


__NOTE: Token verification is only enforced if the user has completed registration. To change this behaviour see Forcing Verification section below.__  
   
   >*Registration is completed once the user installs and registers the Authy mobile app or logins once successfully using SMS.*


To verify users you need the user id and a token. The token you get from the user through your login form. 

    verification = authy_api.tokens.verify('authy-id', 'token-entered-by-the-user')

Once again you can use `ok()` to verify whether the token was valid or not.

    if verification.ok():
        # the user is valid


### Forcing Verification

If you wish to verify tokens even if the user has not yet complete registration, pass force=true when verifying the token.

    verification = authy_api.tokens.verify('authy-id', 'token-entered-by-the-user', {"force": True})

## Requesting SMS Tokens

To request a SMS token you only need the user id.

	sms = authy_api.users.request_sms('authy-id')

As always, you can use `ok()` to verify if the token was sent. To be able to use this method you need to have activated the SMS plugin for your Authy App.

This call will be ignored if the user is using the Authy Mobile App. If you still want to send
the SMS pass force=true as an option

	sms = authy_api.users.request_sms('authy-id', {"force": True});

### Application statistics and details

To request application statistics, use

        statistics = authy_api.app.stats()
        if statistics.ok():
            print statistics.content
        else:
            print statistics.errors()

For application details,

        details = authy_api.app.details()
